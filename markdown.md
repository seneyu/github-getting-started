## What I Learned

I finished reading the Basics of GitHub, it was a good review as I had some experience collaborating on projects. One of the new insights for me was the use of Issues in GitHub. I learned that Issues are not just for reporting bugs, they are also effective for tracking tasks and organizing work in bigger projects. We can also link PRs to Issues, and when a PR that addresses an Issue is merged, GitHub can automatically close the related issue. I hope to use this feature in my future projects to improve workflow.
